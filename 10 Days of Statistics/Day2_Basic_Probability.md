# The answer is:
5/6

# The explanation:

We have to calculate P(X<=9), to do this we have just the porbability which the sum will be greater than 9: P(X<=9) = 1 - P(X>9).

To find the sum greater than 9, we have 4 possiblities: 4+6 or 6+4 or 5+5 for 10 or 6+6 for 12 or 5+6 or 6+5 for 11 which will be : 1/6 * 1/6 * 6 = 6/36. 
Now to calculate P(X<=9) = 1 - 6/36 = 30/36 = 5/6.
