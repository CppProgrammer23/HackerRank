# The explanation:
**The following are the possible trials:**

_U1               U2              U3_

 R                R                B           => 4/7 * 5/9 * 4/8 = 80/504
 
 R                B                R           => 4/7 * 4/9 * 4/8 = 64/504
 
 B                R                R           => 3/7 * 5/9 * 4/8 = 60/504
 
 **The total is : 204/504 which equal to 17/42**
